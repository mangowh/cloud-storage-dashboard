# Bonusx developer interview challenge

## ðŸ“˜ Challenge

### Request

**As a** Fullstack Developer Candidate  
**I want** to build a simple application where users can upload and download files  
**So that** I can demonstrate my ability to integrate a frontend form with a backend API and an AWS S3 storage system

---

### âœ… Acceptance Criteria

- **Given** a user opens the frontend  
  **When** they select a file and submit the form  
  **Then** the file is uploaded to the backend and stored in an S3 bucket

- **Given** a file was uploaded successfully  
  **When** the user receives a confirmation  
  **Then** they should be able to download it back

---

### ðŸ’¡ Nice to Have

- **Authentication**: a simple login system (e.g., with email + password or JWT)
- **File listing**: a list of uploaded files with metadata and download links
- **Presigned URLs**: for secure file uploads/downloads directly to/from S3
- **File validation**: limit allowed file types or sizes

## ðŸš€ How to start

```
yarn && yarn prepare
